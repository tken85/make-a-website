  <h3>What's This?</h3>
  <p> This is my first homework assignment for The Iron Yard's Front-End Engineering Class.</p>
  <p> It's super <span>fancy</span> and will help you learn more about me and my favorite recipes. You will also have the chance to submit your favorites for me to try.</p>
  <h3>About My Cooking</h3>
  <p>Up until 2011 I couldn't cook anything not requiring a microwave. I even once had a friend cook a romantic Valentine's Day meal for me and my then girlfriend. But things changed when I moved in with my sister after graduate school and needed to find something to do to keep me busy during the job hunt when <i>The Price is Right</i> wasn't on. I started learning how to cook vegetarian for her. Then I quickly developed a love for baking, and eventually even branched out to learning how to cook meat once I moved back to Texas. For the past 4 years, I have chronicled these (mis)adventures on my blog <a href="http://www.mymesstheirkitchen.com/" target="_blank">My Mess Their Kitchen</a>. Here are some of my favorites.</p>
